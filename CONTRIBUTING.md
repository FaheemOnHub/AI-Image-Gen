#### React Styleguide

- Use functional components with hooks.
- Extract complex logic into custom hooks.
- Use prop spreading sparingly.
- Use prop types or TypeScript for type checking.

- Group Tailwind classes logically (layout, typography, colors, etc.).
- Extract common class combinations into @apply directives.
- Use semantic color names in Tailwind config.
- Ensure proper contrast for accessibility.

### Testing

- Write unit tests for utility functions.
- Write integration tests for API calls.
- Use React Testing Library for component tests.
- Aim for good coverage, especially in critical paths.
